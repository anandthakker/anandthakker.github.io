After seeing the [incredible geometric designs][1] throughout the Alhambra in
Granada, I wanted to try to explore some of the underlying symmetry and
geometry. I could have jumped straight to the tessellations, but it felt like
a deeper way to get into it would be to build up from basic constructions, and
so, over the course of a few train rides, I started with this. [Demo][2] / [Code][3].

Next up, based on this:
- A tessellation builder using this that will, hopefully, be simultaneously simple to use
  and true to the underlying geometry.
- A geometry proof parser that attempts to generate diagrams based on the text in 
  a proof. (This is very ambitious, but would be very cool.)
