Recording some pending side project ideas or extremely early stage experiments 
here to keep track of them (and keep myself honest!).

1. **node_modules docs search:** A simple server that indexes all the README's
  in `node_modules` exposes them to a super fast search.  Because I'm sick of 
  waiting for github.com or npmjs.org on my crappy internet connection while
  travelling.
2. Explore questions about the age of authors at the time works are published.
  Potential data source: [dbpedia.org][1]
3. **melt-stream:**  The `melt` function from data analysis libraries (e.g. 
  R's "reshape", Python's pandas), but for node streams.  More generally: I'd like
  to look into the state of data analysis modules on npm.  It would be fun to
  port some of the essentials to Nodeland, and even more fun to be able to do heavy
  data analysis there.
4. A better Appalachian Trail map, possibly with some simple trip-planning features.
  (Shapefiles available [here][2].)
