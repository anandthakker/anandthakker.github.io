Pending side project ideas / extremely early stage experiments:
1. **node_modules docs search:** A simple server that indexes all the README's
  in `node_modules` exposes them to a super fast search.  Because I'm sick of 
  googling and waiting for github or npm on my crappy internet connection while
  travelling.
2. Explore questions about the age of authors at the time works are published.
  Potential data source: [dbpedia.org][1]
3. **melt-stream:**  The `melt` function from data reshaping (e.g. R, pandas),
  but for node streams.  More generally: look into the state of data analysis 
  modules on npm.
