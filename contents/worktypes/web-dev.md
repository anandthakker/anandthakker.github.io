I'd be happy to build you a clean, reliable, responsive website; a complex app with a rich
UI; or anything in between.

# I can work with whatever you've got

If you have raw content and branding, I'll work with you to come up with the information architecture
and interaction design for your site or app. If you have a full set of mockups, I'll implement
it quickly with robust, maintainable, standards-compliant code.

I'm well versed in HTML, CSS (and SASS/LESS), Javascript (and coffeescript!), AngularJS.

I also enjoy working with new languages or frameworks (and I certainly never charge for my research time.)
