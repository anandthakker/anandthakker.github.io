I found this waiting for me when I got to my desk Friday morning, and
just about shat my pants.  I'd been talking to three students the day
before, and had shown them a printed out image of one of these
constructions from [this
site.](http://momath.org/home/math-monday-12-14-09/)  One of them, using
only the photo I'd given her, proceeded to go home and build the damn
thing.  Um, yeah.  Math and being a teacher pretty much rule.  



Oh, yeah.  It's built using no glue whatsoever, and every one of the
sixty cards is cut in exactly the same way.
