Is it just me, or is describing a complex data model in Javascript (or
any non-statically-typed language) just... not as good?

I mean, my friend [Aaron
White](http://restrictionisexpression.tumblr.com) and I used to be
rather zealous about the beauty of type safety, and while we had our
serious beefs with Java, at least it gave us a robust way of defining a
data model.  

Now, I am totally blown away by what's happened to front-end web
development since I've been gone these past 8 years.   The ability to
make complex client-side applications is powerful, super fun, and
freeing.

But as thrilled as I am playing around with AngularJS and Node and
dozens of brilliantly designed libraries, the one thing I still kinda
hate is that I'm having to either remember or keep looking up my damn
model.  I long for the Java days when my IDE could complete my sentences
(though Sublime Text fakes it alright at least for symbols defined
within the current file), and more importantly, when I didn't have to
wait till run-time to find out that I'd misspelled a property name. 

Am I just not getting the new paradigm or something?
