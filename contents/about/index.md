Hi. I'm Anand Thakker. Depending on the year or season, I'm either a **software developer**,
a high school **math and CS teacher**, or some combination of the two.
Regardless of the year or season, I'm eager to play
with new ideas, build things, and try to do some good.

#### Current status:
Building a GL-powered map rendering engine at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com).
