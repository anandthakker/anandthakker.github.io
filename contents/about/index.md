Hi. I'm Anand Thakker. Depending on the year or season, I'm either a **software developer**,
a high school **math and CS teacher**, or some combination of the two.
Regardless of the year or season, I'm eager to play
with new ideas, make cool stuff, and try to do some good.

####Current status:
Traveling until Spring 2015.
