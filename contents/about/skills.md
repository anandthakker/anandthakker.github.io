- I'm comfortable working up and down the so-called "full stack." (How else can you
  know you're solving a problem in the right place?)
- I can think about architecture, design data structures, and analyze
  algorithms.
- I care about modularity and API design.
- I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and I'm flexible about 
  different approaches to writing code and building software.
- I work and play well with others.
