Rather than claiming skills with specific languages or environments, I'll just say:

- I like to think about software architecture and algorithms, fine-grained performance optimizations, and everything in between.
- I enjoy learning new languages and systems, and I'm flexible about different
  approaches to writing code and building software.
- I work and play well with others.
