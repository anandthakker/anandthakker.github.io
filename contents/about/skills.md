I'm comfortable hacking in anything from Python to C/C++, but the vast
majority of my recent experience is with Javascript (Node & browser).  More
importantly:

- I like to think about software architecture and algorithms, fine-grained performance optimizations, and everything in between.
- I enjoy learning new languages and systems, and I'm flexible about different
  approaches to writing code and building software.
- I work and play well with others.
