The content for the math curriculum that my colleagues and I wrote (see ['Curriculum Writing'](/resume/#curriculum-writing) below) has been locked up in about 40 InDesign documents, along with thousands equations in the form of MathType .EPS files. I'm in the process of:

1. Extracting/converting the content into clean HTML.
2. Using *CSS* (well, *SASS*) to reproduce the existing design/layout in print (via
  PrinceXML) and also translate it to the web.
3. Using Jekyll and [Prose](http://github.com/prose/prose) to automate the publishing
  workflow (since most of my co-authors don't know HTML very well).
