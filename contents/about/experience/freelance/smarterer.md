Implemented this [live, responsive site](http://smarterer.com) from PSD design.
(The headache of dealing with IE 8 support motivated me to build [doiuse](https://github.com/anandthakker/doiuse).)

Also extended, polished up, and documented the [sample Flask app](https://github.com/smarterer/leaderboard) that Smarterer use as an example to accompany their API documentation.
