Translated PSD comps into a [live, responsive site](http://smarterer.com). 
(The headache of having to go *back* through the CSS to figure out where I'd
used stuff not supported by IE8 motivated me to make [doiuse](https://github.com/anandthakker/doiuse).)

Also extended, polished up, and documented the [sample Flask app](https://github.com/smarterer/leaderboard) that Smarterer use as an example to accompany their API documentation.
