1. [EuclidJS](/projects/euclid/) Euclidean geometry in javascript: a library to parse
an English-language description of a geometry figure, model it, and render it with
SVG. (The dynamic background on my [front page](/) is an example of this.)

2. [doiuse.com](http://doiuse.com) A site and its accompanying tool for linting CSS
for browser support using [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com) data and convenient
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)-like browser description.

3. Also, a former student and I have started working on an app that we aren't quite ready to
talk about yet.  We're enjoying using *Django REST* on the back end and *Angular* + *ES6*
on the front end.  Still trying to decide whether we'll go hybrid or native for 
smaller devices.
