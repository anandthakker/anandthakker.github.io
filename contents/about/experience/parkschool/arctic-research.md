After joining the Arctic Research program as a chaperone in 2012, I soon became
the <i>de facto</i> data analyst of the group, both managing / analyzing / visualizing
the 9-year, 40-variable, multi-1000-row dataset and teaching students the
statistical programming language **R** so that they could do so themselves.
