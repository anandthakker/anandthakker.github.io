From 2007 to 2010, my colleagues and I worked together to write our own textbook series for 9th-11th grade math, centered on problems and problem solving rather than on facts and techniques. Rejecting the notion of a teacher-proof textbook that legalistically lays out the steps of a technique and all its potential edge cases and variations, we chose instead to create a text whose purpose was to generate rich and messy mathematical conversations.  So there are no explanations, no worked out examples, no reference material&mdash;all of that is the work of the students and teacher together in the classroom.
