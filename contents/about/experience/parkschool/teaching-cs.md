Developed two semester-long introductory programming 
courses--*Game Programming* and *Web Design and Programming*.  Both were 
project-centered, designed to get students making real stuff as soon as possible
and based on the principle that important theoretical principles are best learned
when they help you understand a genuine problem you're facing.

Supervised independent studies for advanced students on *Data Structures 
and Algorithms*, *Speech Processing and Production*, and *Computer Graphics 
(Ray Tracing)*.
