Taught courses ranging from basic ninth grade math to Abstract Algebra.  Regardless of the particular content or the ability level of the students, my approach to teaching math has always focused on problem solving, exploratory thinking, and reasoning.  It's about the joy of puzzles, the value of skepticism, and the beauty of proof.
