My friend [Aaron][1] and I stayed after work one day, excitedly discussing an 
idea we'd had for how we could use the programming language theory we'd learned
in college to overcome some important limitations in one of Mindreef's product 
features.  A few late nights later, we'd built a prototype, and a couple weeks
after that, we had PML, an underlying type system to consolidate and coherently 
represent the typing information scattered throughout collections of WSDL and XML Schema documents.  Theoretically elegant as this was, the real importance of this work
was in enabling multiple unique, core features in Mindreef's products.
