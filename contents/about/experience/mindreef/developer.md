Worked as a member of the 6-person dev team, with both solo responsibility
for major parts of the codebase and collaborative responsibility for developing
features, general maintenance, testing, bug fixes, etc.  The main product was a
Java server with a rich web UI (despite the savage and perilous pre-jQuery era),
but there was also substantial work in C#/.NET.
