Started programming as a kid; was captivated by algorithms, programming language
theory, and functional programming in college; worked in a software startup
making tools for Web Services (WSDL/SOAP) developers for a few years; left
software to teach high school for seven years.

Returned to coding recently to find all sorts of strange and fascinating
changes in the software world: e.g., actual UX in open source (GitHub),
Javascript as a mature language (with a sometimes-mature community), serious
discussions about diversity and accessibility.  I'm liking it.
