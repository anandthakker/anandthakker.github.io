Started programming as a kid; was captivated by algorithms, programming language 
theory, and functional programming in college; worked in a software startup making
tools for Web Services (WSDL/SOAP) developers for a few years; left software to 
teach high school for seven years.

Returned to coding recently to find it a glorious new world of thriving open 
source projects, clean REST API's for *everything*, elegant functional programming 
in production code, and citizen coders/entrepreneurs trying to help people and 
the planet.  Count me in.
