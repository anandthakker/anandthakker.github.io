Started programming as a kid; was captivated by algorithms, programming language 
theory, and functional programming in college; worked in Java + Javascript on
Web Services (WSDL/SOAP) for a few years; left software to teach high school 
for seven years.

Returned to coding recently to find it a glorious new world of thriving open 
source projects, mature functional code in production, and citizen 
coders/entrepreneurs trying to help people and the planet: count me in.
