Started programming as a kid; was captivated by algorithms, programming language 
theory, and functional programming in college; worked in Java + javascript for a
few years (in the savage and perilous pre-jQuery era); left software to 
teach high school for seven years.

Returned to coding recently to find it a glorious new world of thriving open 
source projects, mature functional code in production, and citizen 
coders/entrepreneurs trying to help people and the planet: count me in.
