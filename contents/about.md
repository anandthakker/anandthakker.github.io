# Hi. I'm Anand.

Depending on the year or season, I'm either a **software developer**,
a high school **math and CS teacher**, or some combination of the two.
Regardless of the year or season, I'm eager to wander the world, play
with new ideas, and make cool stuff.

####Current status:
Available for freelance. If you need help with a project
or website, please get in touch!
