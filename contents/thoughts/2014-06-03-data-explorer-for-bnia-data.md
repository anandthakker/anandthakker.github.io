Partly in response to a local challenge for this year's [#hackforchange][1],
[Bryan Connor][2] and I built a simple app for exploring a set of data about
Baltimore neighborhoods.  The data, curated/collected by [BNIA][3], includes
dozens of different indicators about 55 "Community Statistical Areas" in Baltimore.

The idea here is to make a way to explore indicators and neighborhoods
of interest and easily share whatever you find/see in the data.  (The latter could
make this useful to individuals trying to advocate for programs and grants for
their neighborhoods.)

A work in progress, for sure, but here's [the current live version][4] and [the github repo][5].
