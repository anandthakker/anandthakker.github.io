        <section class="work-type">
          <h3>Web Dev &amp; Design</h3>

          <p>I'd be happy to build you a clean, reliable, responsive website; a complex app with a rich
            UI; or anything in between.</p>

          <h4>I can work with whatever you've got.</h4>
          <p>
            If you have raw content and branding, I'll work with you to come up with the information architecture
            and interaction design for your site or app. If you have a full set of mockups, I'll implement
            it quickly with robust, maintainable, standards-compliant code.
          </p>
          <p>I'm well versed in
            <strong>HTML5</strong>,
            <strong>CSS3
              <small>(+ Sass/Compass, Less)</small>
            </strong>,
            <strong>Javascript

            </strong>,
            <strong>
              <abbr title="Twitter Bootstrap">twbs</abbr>
            </strong>,
            <strong>AngularJS</strong>. I also enjoy working with new languages or frameworks (and I certainly
            never charge for my research time.)

        <section class="work-type">
          <h3>Middle &amp; Back End</h3>
          <p>I'm just as happy to work server-side&mdash;in fact, that's where the bulk of my past experience was focused. So, whether it's setting up your CMS/e-commerce site, working on a database layer + a RESTful API, or anything in between, I'm game.

            <em>love</em>using
            <strong>R</strong>
            and
            <strong>d3.js</strong>
            to play with data, whether it be to run statistical analyses or to create effective, truthful, interactive
            visualizations.

            <h4>Teaching: Math</h4>
            <p>I've taught courses ranging from basic ninth grade math to Abstract Algebra.  Regardless of the particular content or the ability level of the students, my approach to teaching math has always focused on problem solving, exploratory thinking, and reasoning.  It's about the joy of puzzles and the beauty of proof.</p>

          <section class="experience" id="curriculum-writing">
            <h4>Co-Author: Park School Mathematics Textbook Series</h4>
            <p>From 2007 to 2010, my colleagues and I worked together to write our own textbook series for 9th-11th grade math. Our idea was to design a curriculum that was centered on problems and problem solving rather than on facts and techniques.  We rejected the notion of a teacher-proof textbook that legalistically lays out the steps of a technique and all its potential edge cases and variations, choosing instead to create a text whose purpose was to generate rich and messy mathematical conversations.  So there are no explanations, no worked out examples, no reference material&mdash;all of that is the work of the students and teacher together in the classroom.

      <!-- /experience -->






      <!--       <p>
        My young, nerdy life of studying math and computer science instilled in me a deep love of the elegance
        and power of theory. Then, as a software developer and a teacher, I quickly came to relish working
        with smart people engaged in more practical, everyday problem solving.
      </p>
 -->
      <!--       Working with students is a humbling education in the difference between what you expect people to think and what they actually think.

      I can write a custom graph traversal or manipulation algorithm, but I also know when I'm better off using a library.

      Clean, well-documented code that's easy to maintain either by me or by whoever's working on it next.

      What I've Done
      Teaching
      Math, programming, computer science, web design
      In all of these: whole range of skill levels - very advanced (undergrad-level) to very basic
      Math teaching: focus on problem solving rather than rote technique
      Programming teaching: blend of hands-on making and deeper understanding of concepts
      Co-wrote 9-11th grade curriculum (Also did layout - amateur design)
      Advised independent studies in: data structures and algorithms (3 times), computer graphics, computational audio processing
      Arctic Research

      Mindreef
      Full stack developer, working on database (SQL) to front end (a dynamic web UI, back in 2004), and everything in between (Java server-side business logic).
      Developed a complete yet vastly simpler and more accessible grammar for parsing WSDL documents (types) and SOAP messages (values), type-checking messages, and displaying the results in an IDE-like human-readable form.
