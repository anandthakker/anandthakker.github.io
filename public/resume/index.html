            <h2>Background</h2><p>Started programming as a kid; was captivated by <strong>algorithms</strong>, programming language 
theory, and <strong>functional programming</strong> in college; worked in a software startup making
tools for Web Services (<span class="caps">WSDL</span>/SOAP) developers for a few years; left software to 
teach high school for seven&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Returned to coding recently to find it a glorious new world of thriving open 
source projects, clean <span class="caps">REST</span> API’s for <em>everything</em>, elegant functional programming 
in production code, and citizen coders/entrepreneurs trying to help people and 
the planet.  <strong>Count me&nbsp;in.</strong></p>

            <h2>Skills</h2><ul>
<li>I’m comfortable working up and down the so-called “full stack.” (How else can you
know you’re solving a problem in the right&nbsp;place?)</li>
<li>I can think about architecture, design data structures, and analyze&nbsp;algorithms.</li>
<li>I care about modularity and <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;design.</li>
<li>I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks, and I’m flexible about 
different approaches to writing code and building&nbsp;software.</li>
<li>I work and play well with&nbsp;others.</li>

Rejecting the notion of a teacher-proof textbook that legalistically lays out the steps of a technique and all its potential edge cases and variations, we chose instead to create a text whose purpose was to generate rich and messy mathematical conversations.  So there are no explanations, no worked out examples, no reference material&mdash;all of that is the work of the students and teacher together in the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
