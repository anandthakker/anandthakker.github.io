                <h4>Teaching: Math and&nbsp;Statistics</h4><p>I’ve taught courses ranging from basic ninth grade math to Abstract Algebra.  Regardless of the particular content or the ability level of the students, my approach to teaching math has always focused on problem solving, exploratory thinking, and reasoning.  It’s about the joy of puzzles and the beauty of&nbsp;proof.</p>

              <section id="teaching-cs" class="work">
                <h4>Teaching: Computer&nbsp;Science</h4><p>I developed two semester-long introductory programming 
courses—<em>Game Programming</em> and <em>Web Design and Programming</em>.  Both were 
project-centered, designed to get students making real stuff as soon as possible
and based on the principle that important theoretical principles are best learned
when they help you understand a genuine problem you’re&nbsp;facing.</p>
<p>I also supervised independent studies for advanced students on <em>Data Structures 
and Algorithms</em>, <em>Speech Processing and Production</em>, and <em>Computer Graphics 
(Ray Tracing)</em>.</p>

                <h4>Co-Author: Park School Mathematics Textbook&nbsp;Series</h4><p>From 2007 to 2010, my colleagues and I worked together to write our own textbook series for 9<span class="ord">th</span>-11<span class="ord">th</span> grade math. Our idea was to design a curriculum that was centered on problems and problem solving rather than on facts and techniques.  We rejected the notion of a teacher-proof textbook that legalistically lays out the steps of a technique and all its potential edge cases and variations, choosing instead to create a text whose purpose was to generate rich and messy mathematical conversations.  So there are no explanations, no worked out examples, no reference material&mdash;all of that is the work of the students and teacher together in the&nbsp;classroom.</p>

the <i>de facto</i> data analyst of the group, both managing / analyzing / visualizing
the rather 9-year, 40-variable, multi-1000-row dataset and teaching students the
statistical programming language <strong>R</strong> so that they could do so&nbsp;themselves.</p>

idea we’d had for how we could use the programming language theory we’d learned
in college to overcome some important limitations in one of Mindreef’s product 
features.  A few late nights later, we’d built a prototype, and a couple weeks
after that, we had <span class="caps">PML</span>, an underlying type system to consolidate and coherently 
represent the typing information scattered throughout collections of WSDL and XML Schema documents.  Theoretically elegant as this was, the real importance of this work
was in enabling multiple unique, core features in Mindreef’s&nbsp;products.</p>
